# Presenter-next-server

The idea behind presenter-next is to capture live feedback from the audience whilst giving a presentation.  The attendees of a talk can vote on the current slide, indicating whether the content is at the right pace or level desired.

The project is in two parts, with this project being the server-side webapp using [Ring]() & [Compojure]()

The client-side app is located at https://github.com/jr0cket/presenter-next

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
